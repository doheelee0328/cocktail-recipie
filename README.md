# Cocktail recipe

Our team worked collaboratively to design and develop a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on creating a platform for users to explore and learn about different cocktail recipes. The website includes a homepage that features a navigation bar, allowing users to easily access different sections of the website.

One of the notable features of the website is the "Favorite Recipes" section, which allows users to easily access their preferred cocktail recipes. Additionally, your team implemented a newsletter sign-up feature, enabling users to receive regular updates on new recipes and other content on the website.

The website is designed to be user-friendly, with clear instructions and beautiful images for each cocktail recipe. Each section of the website features a visually appealing image that captures the essence of the cocktails being showcased, enhancing the overall user experience.

Users can browse different cocktail recipes and learn about their ingredients and preparation, with detailed descriptions and step-by-step instructions provided. Our team paid close attention to the website's overall usability, ensuring that it is easy to navigate and interact with.

## Improvement 

While we were happy with the overall design and functionality of the website, we recognized that it could have been more responsive to different devices.

Specifically, we realized that we could have used Bootstrap and media queries to optimize the website for different devices, but we did not feel confident enough to implement these tools at the time.

Next time, when working on other group projects, I plan to challenge myself to learn more about Bootstrap and media queries, and other responsive design techniques, so that I can create more accessible and user-friendly websites that look great on any device. 

Overall, we are proud of what we achieved with our cocktail recipe website, but we recognize that there is always room for improvement and growth in our skills.
